    <td>Engagement: How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Kahoot is a very fun and engaging learing experience that rewards you for knowing the answers and answering the question quickly. This promates the user to study. It also adds friendly competition among peers. It has a colourful design and the interface is very interactive. This really helps in keeping the user engaged and excited to learn. (10/10) </td>
    <td style=background-color:red>Studyclix is a bland website that has a bad interface that can be confusing for the average user. It has a bland design and fails in my opinion to keep the user fully engaged. However the app is functional and if the user somehow manages to stay engaged it can be very rewarding (3/10)</td>
    <td style=background-color:orange>Quizlet is a engaging website that has lots of animations and makes you have complete attention on the material you are learning. The website is rather bland past this although which could possible make the user lose intrest in the material that there are tying to learn. (7/10)</td>
  </tr>
    <td>Progress tracking: How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Kahoot uses a score system within the learning game and keeps track of how many questions you got right or wrong. It even keeps track of the streak of questions you have gotten right in a row. This rewards the player with bonus points within the learning game. It does not howerver provide good feedback past how many questions you have gotten wrong and doesn't recommend the users other materials to further their knowledge of a subject. (7/10)</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Studyclix is very good for progress tracking. It keeps track of what you have studied and recommends lots of bonus material should you wish to further you knowledge within a certain subject or topic. It does a very good job also of personalizing the learning experience for what is best for the user and provided well communicated feedback to see what the user may need help with. (9/10)</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Quizlet is rather good at providing feedback and does well at helping users learn. It provided aadequate feedback that supports the users journey of studying. Its also fantastic at personalizing the learning experience so that the user may get the most out of their time studying instead of searching for the right topic or subject to study. It has a good system for tracking user progress and lets the user know exactly how much they have studied. (8/10) </td>
  </tr>
    <td>User experience: How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Kahoot is a very user friendly app to use. It is extremely easy to use and has clear instructions on screen on what to do at all times.The interface is very well designed and I would say that even someone newer to computers can use this app to help them study. (9/10)  </td>
    <td style=background-color:red>Studyclix is not a user friendly app. Its interface is cluttered and poorly designed. Menus can be hard to find and searching for certain topics may seem near impossible. It does not have clear instructions or clear prompts. (2/10)</td>
    <td style=background-color:lime>Quizlet is a user friendly website that can be very easy to navigate. It has clear instructions and prompts that make the user know what is happening at all times. The interface while minimal is well designed and has no real apprent flaws and can be used by someone fairly new to computers. (8/10)</td>
